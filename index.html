            <p>
                Ever since I discovered <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/" target="_blank">Tampermonkey</a>, I've been writing scripts to improve my experience on sites I frequently visited.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've published a few of these scripts to greasyfork under the name <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/users/117222-somerandomguy-2">someRandomGuy <span title="I swear I didn't used to have a 2 next to my name">2</span></a>, but kept most of them private.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, these private scripts began to pile up, and I thought, "other people would beneifit from them too," so I decided to put them (most of them) up on Github.
            </p>
            <p>
                NOTE: You will need Tampermonkey to run these scripts. <br>
                I created an alternative: <a href="pages/bookmarklets/">Userscript Bookmarklets</a>, if you'd like to try to use them without installing Tampermonkey
