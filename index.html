        <h1> JaPNaA's Userscripts </h1>
        <p>
            Ever since I discovered <a id="tampermonkeyLink">Tampermonkey</a>, I've been writing scripts to improve my experience on sites I frequently visited.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've published a few of these scripts to greasyfork under the name <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/users/117222-somerandomguy-2">someRandomGuy <span title="I swear I didn't used to have a 2 next to my name">2</span></a>, but kept most of them private.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, these private scripts began to pile up, and I thought, "other people would beneifit from them too," so I decided to put them (most of them) up on Github.
